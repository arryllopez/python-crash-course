# Python Crash Course Exercises

Working through *Python Crash Course* by Eric Matthes to master my Python fundamentals.  
This repo includes exercises and mini-projects covering:

- Basics: variables, loops, conditionals, functions  
- Data structures: lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets  
- File handling and exceptions  
- Object-oriented programming and classes  
- Hands-on projects to apply what I learn

Each commit represents progress in my journey to become a confident Python developer.
